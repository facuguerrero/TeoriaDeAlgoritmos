This repository consists of three parts:

### TP1

Consist of an implementation of the following algorithms:
* Galey-Shapley: responsible for solving the stable matching problem.
* Kosaraju: responsible for finding strongly connected components in a graph.
* Hopcroft and Tarjan: responsible for finding cut vertices in a graph.

It can be found [here](https://github.com/facuguerrero/TeoriaDeAlgoritmos/tree/master/TP1).


### TP2

Consist of different implementations of the algorithm to solve the shortest path problem in a graph. Among them are:
* Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes.
* Floyd-Warshall’s algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.
* Bellman-Ford’s algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.

It can be found [here](https://github.com/facuguerrero/TeoriaDeAlgoritmos/tree/master/TP2).


### TP3

Consist of an implementation of the following algorithms:
* Kadane’s algorithm for solving the maximum subarray problem.
* Karger’s randomized algorithm for computing the minimum cut of a connected graph.
* An approximation algorithm for solving the subset sum problem, which belongs to NPC.

It can be found [here](https://github.com/facuguerrero/TeoriaDeAlgoritmos/tree/master/TP3).
